# React Native CRUD App

This project is a full-stack mobile application built with React Native and powered by Supabase. It is a simple to-do list app that demonstrates the core functionality of a CRUD system: Create, Read, Update, and Delete. Users can manage their tasks in real time with authentication and seamless navigation.

## What is CRUD?

CRUD stands for:

**Create** – Add a new task  
**Read** – View your list of tasks  
**Update** – Modify an existing task  
**Delete** – Remove a task from the list

These four operations form the backbone of most modern applications. Understanding how to build them provides a strong foundation for full-stack development and backend interaction.

## Transition from JavaScript to React to React Native

This project marks a significant step in my development journey. Starting from basic JavaScript, I progressed into React, which introduced the concept of reusable components and a declarative UI approach for web development.

React Native extends those same principles to mobile development. It enables developers to build cross-platform apps using the same logic and architecture learned in React, but optimized for native performance on iOS and Android devices.

## The Power of JSX

JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension that allows writing HTML-like code within JavaScript. This approach improves code readability and tightly integrates UI structure with application logic. Though it appears similar to HTML, it is ultimately transformed into JavaScript under the hood. JSX is one of the key features that makes React and React Native development intuitive and efficient.

## Navigation with Expo Router

For routing and screen navigation, this app uses Expo Router. Unlike traditional navigation libraries that require manual configuration, Expo Router introduces a file-based routing system. By organizing screens as files and folders, the routing structure becomes clearer and more maintainable. This approach aligns with modern best practices in frontend architecture.

## Backend Integration with Supabase

Supabase was used to manage the backend functionalities of this app, including authentication and real-time data storage. As an open-source alternative to Firebase, Supabase offers an easy-to-use dashboard and instant APIs for interacting with your database. It enables secure user login and data handling without the complexity of building a custom backend from scratch.
